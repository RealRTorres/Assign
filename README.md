Brief Description:
This Java program uses a HashMap to store students's names and their grades. And then the user can update the grades.

The programming conpcepts and tools that were employed with this assignment was using the Scanner and HashMap classes. It shows the benefit of the HashMap where duplicated keys can be overwritten. Plus the data types are specified using wrapper classes in stead of primitive data types.

The expected inputs of the application is using the pre-entered Students's grades (ie. Harry Rawlins, Stephanie Kong, etc.) to enter their name and new grade. If one    were to add a non-existent student, they'll be added.

The expected outputs of the application is :
  StudentName's original grade: (old grade)
  StudentName's new grade: (new grade)
If adding a nonexistent student, it will add them, their original grade will be null, and store the new grade.
